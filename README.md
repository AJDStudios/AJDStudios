- AJDStudios is my most common monika online, and is usually shortened to A.D. 
- I'm primarily a creative - writing, art, design, music, game dev, and streaming. 
- At the moment, I'm working on an updated portfolio. 
- I do work full-time as a Software Engineer for MyHealthChecked.com. The github I use for professional work is AJDDevelopment. 
- All my contact details will soon be available on the Portfolio repo and page linked to this account. 

Let's build a better world.

    - built off of create-react app, includes many essential foundational needs for any workflow on any project using React.   
 - Online Resume (rebuilding)
   - My old resume was fine... but it's no longer a great representation of what I can do - so I'm rebuilding it with the repo remaining open
   - Mini-projects (3 of 10 exist as MVP)
    - These will be built directly into the portfolio for the most part.
    - 
## Bigger projects or future projects - All planned and scoped
    - WOD website - fairly involved project that hosts all information and iterations of Worlds of Demons work, this will also function as an author site. Long-term I see this as my day job, but for now we're building. 
    - Language exchange website (early design - not a priority)
    - Vocabulary tennis - a game for language learners to practice their vocabulary skills (deep in conception and roadmap)
