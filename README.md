- AJDStudios is my most common monika online, and is usually shortened to A.D. 
- I'm primarily a creative, writing, art, design, music, game dev, video editing and streaming, though the latter two have taken a break over the last few months. 
- At the moment, I'm working on frontend work through React primarily, finalising my webpage resume, building a site for the above creative work, building mini-projects 
and working on games when time allows. 
- Currently I'm looking for work in frontend development, wanting a teaste of the more formal side of things and collaborating in a team, as most of my work has been solo.
- All my contact details are available on the Resume repo and page linked to this account. 

Let's build a better world together.
