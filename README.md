- AJDStudios is my most common monika online, and is usually shortened to A.D. 
- I'm primarily a creative - writing, art, design, music, game dev, video editing and streaming, though the latter two have taken a break over the last few months. 
- At the moment, I'm working on knocking some-mini projects out to get into a habit of doing so before working on some more ambitious projects. 
- I do work full-time as a Frontend software engineer for MyHealthChecked.com. The github I use for professional work is AJDDevelopment. 
- All my contact details are available on the Resume repo and page linked to this account. 

Let's build a better world.

Current projects
  Robust React template (Stable release launched (27/05/23) - still working on a web-dev specific release)
   - built off of create-react app, includes many essential foundational needs for any workflow on any project using React.   
   - next steps: 
        - Add some basic functions used in web development (other projects can still use the current version)
        - add a couple easter eggs
        - deploy to the web as an example template. 
  Online Resume (redesigning)
    - My current resume works fine... but it's no longer a great representation of what I can do
    - Using the above mentioned template when finished, I'll be migrating much of the content and updating functionality from there
  Mini-projects (3 of 10 exist as MVP)
    - Again using the template I'll be looking to complete 10 mini-projects that are fairly quick to make, but can showcase some skills and some will even be useful to me in my day-to-day
    - once all ten are ready - I plan to host them on one containerised deployment and add it as a portfolio point for those interested. 

Bigger projects or future projects
    - WOD website - fairly involved project that hosts all information and iterations of Worlds of Demons work, this will also function as an author site. Long-term I see this as my day job, but for now we're building. 
    - Language exchange website (early design - not a priority)
    - Vocabulary tennis - a game for language learners to practice their vocabulary skills (deep in conception and roadmap)
    - 3 worlds of demons games (each in different stages of development, but looking to really make them work  -an RPG exists as an MVP, but I want to iterate much further on it.)
