- AJDStudios is my most common monika online, and is usually shortened to A.D. 
- I'm primarily a creative - writing, art, design, music, game dev, video editing and streaming, though the latter two have taken a break over the last few months. 
- At the moment, I'm working on knocking some-mini projects out to get into a habit of doing so before working on some more ambitious projects. 
- I do work full-time as a Frontend software engineer for MyHealthChecked.com. The github I use for professional work is AJDDevelopment. 
- All my contact details are available on the Resume repo and page linked to this account. 

Let's build a better world.
